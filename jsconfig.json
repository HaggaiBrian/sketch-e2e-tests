/*
I shall use this jsconfig.json file to create a intellisense autocompletion for the entire project in one place,
instead of having /// <reference types="cypress" /> command added in each and every single test spec file. This
promotes easy code maintainance, reusability of code and prevents unnecessary code duplication. 
NB. This file is specific and only understood by VS code. Other IDE's like intellij, webstorm, may not understand it.
